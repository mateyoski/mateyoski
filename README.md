# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Maciek and I'm a guy passionate about software security and servers. I graduated from AGH UST as a Power Engineer but my interests have shifted since. I try to continuously expand my knowledge on networks and secure approaches to software.
I'm currently learning:
- Web Development using Vanilla JS - The Odin Project
- CompTIA A+ - Professor Messer lecture snippets
